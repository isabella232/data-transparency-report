## Twilio Transparency Report for the First Half of 2017

Twilio's developer ecosystem, customers and end users expect Twilio to protect their personal information, sensitive data and user privacy. That responsibility includes how Twilio handles government requests received.

This is Twilio's fifth transparency report detailing requests for customer information by municipal, state, provincial and federal governments globally for the first six months of 2017. As part of Twilio’s commitment to the privacy of your data, and consistent with our core value of “no shenanigans”, we compile this semi-annual report to provide visibility to the Twilio community around governmental requests received.

In the first half of 2017, Twilio received 1169 government requests for user information compared to 268 requests in the first half of 2015. Twilio’s historical transparency reports can be found at [https://www.twilio.com/legal/transparency](https://www.twilio.com/legal/transparency).

In the spirit of trust and “no shenanigans”, the objective of this report is to inform you of the total volume of government requests for information received by Twilio in the preceding six month period, how Twilio responded to the requests and how often Twilio notified its users of the requests.

### What government requests for user information did Twilio receive?
  
In the first half of 2017, Twilio received 1169 government requests for user information across 363 Twilio customer accounts.

Of the 1169 requests received, 389 requests came from federal, state and local agencies within the United States. The majority of the other requests were issued by international agencies, primarily in France (325), Germany (263) and the United Kingdom (92).

Notes:

* Twilio applies the same scrutiny to international requests as for domestic requests.
* Twilio tracks mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) requests served by the United States Department of Justice - Office of International Affairs according to the country that originates the request.
* Twilio began receiving and responding to requests from France’s Groupement Interministériel de Contrôle in 2017, and these requests will be included in the Twilio transparency report moving forward.

Notes:

* “Customer Contact Information” includes information such as a Twilio customer’s user name, email address, company name or company contact information, where available.
* “Additional Information” includes any information provided beyond the Customer Contact Information described above. This may include call logs, message logs, message body content, phone number creation date, address on file for a specific phone number or other information.

Twilio furnished no message body content (0) or call recordings (0) during the first half of 2017.
* “Twilio Declined to Furnish” means Twilio did not provide Customer Contact Information or Additional Information. This could be due to insufficient documentation, concerns about jurisdiction or unavailable records.
* “Requests Withdrawn” means a government agency submitted and subsequently withdrew a request. Upon receiving a government request, Twilio notifies agencies that Twilio intends to disclose the existence of the request to a customer unless explicitly prohibited from doing so by law, thus allowing agencies to withdraw the request to prevent disclosure.

Notes:

* “Exigent Requests” are responses where Twilio may have provided information in advance of receiving a fully executed request from law enforcement. Under Twilio’s privacy policy, Twilio may disclose information to law enforcement in the case of an emergency where there is a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person that Twilio may have information necessary to prevent. 
Twilio responded to 25 exigent requests in the first half of 2017, and 16 agencies ultimately produced a court order, subpoena or search warrant in response to the request.
* “Functionality Disablement” means a government agency requested or required Twilio remove phone numbers from service. In previous versions of Twilio transparency reports this category was known as “takedown requests”. 
In the first half of 2017, Twilio received 9 disablement requests affecting 7 customer accounts.
* “Police Force Order” refers to an international government or law enforcement agency making a direct request to Twilio. Twilio applies the same scrutiny to international requests as for domestic requests. In certain countries Twilio has distinguished the format of requests: in Canada, federal police requests can be issued in the form of Production Orders, in the United Kingdom, Regulatory of Investigatory Powers Act of 2000 (RIPA), in Germany police force orders and in France, Groupement Interministériel de Contrôle (GIC) requests.

### Twilio’s Comment on National Security Letters

The data above does not reflect any National Security Letters Twilio may have received. 

Companies are broadly prohibited by law from disclosing the specific number of National Security Letters they receive. The US Department of Justice has maintained that companies may only disclose the number of National Security Letters it has received in set ranges.

Therefore, Twilio indicates receiving between 0 and 999 National Security Letters in the time range of January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017. 

Twilio is encouraged that in accordance with the USA Freedom Act of 2015, the Department of Justice notified some companies that the nondisclosure order on national security letters expired, and accordingly, these companies published the letters and retroactively restated the ranges of the National Security Letters they received to positively indicate they received requests over a set time period. Twilio is encouraged by this effort to increase transparency and encourages the new Department of Justice leadership to maintain this practice. 

Twilio continues to oppose the prohibition on companies from disclosing the specific number of National Security Letters received by a company.  Twilio opposes this prohibition based on the belief that government requests should not be issued in secret, and should only be issued with proper transparency, accountability and oversight.

Twilio believes that judicial review provides necessary oversight. Should Twilio receive requests that are issued without the review of a court, such as National Security Letters, 
Twilio will ask the agent to instead produce a court order.

### What notifications of government requests for user information did Twilio send to affected customers?

In accordance with Twilio’s Privacy Policy, Twilio notifies customers of compliance with a government request whenever not prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order.  

In the United States and United Kingdom, Twilio’s ability to notify customers depends on whether a request contains a non-disclosure order. This is in contrast to some countries, most notably Germany and Japan, where certain regulations statutorily prohibit companies from disclosing to their customers that they have responded to requests for information.

In the first half of 2017, Twilio responded to 875 government requests for user information and notified the impacted customers of 139 of those requests.

Notes:
* The percentage of requests where Twilio notified a customer decreased from 20% to 12% between the Second Half of 2016 and the First Half of 2017 Transparency Reports. Twilio attributes this reduction two two factors: 1) an increase in international requests where disclosure is prohibited by regulation and 2) an increase in the number of agencies who submitted a nondisclosure demand after being notified of Twilio’s privacy policy.

### Conclusion

Twilio's developers, customers and end users expect the Twilio platform to be secure and private. Twilio is mindful of these expectations and takes seriously the trust that users place when choosing the Twilio platform.

The 363 customers for whom Twilio received government requests as indicated in this report represent a fraction of a percentage of all Twilio accounts. Due to the restraint on free speech imposed by current law, this report does not include any requests that may have been subject to National Security Letters.

Twilio will continue to publish a semiannual transparency report. Please be advised that Twilio may restate data going forward if more complete information becomes available or if Twilio changes classifications.
